        <h1>Leaderboard</h1>

        <p>The leaderboard ranking order is dictated by Elo. Champions with a higher elo are better than those with a lower elo.When one champion beats another champion, elo is taken from the loser and given to the winner, relative to each of their elo's according to a formula called the Elo Algorithm, most famously used for chess rankings. Winning against a stronger opponent will give the winner more elo, while winning against a weaker opponent will give the winner less elo.
